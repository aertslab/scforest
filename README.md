# scforest, a visual overview of single cell technology
The single cell forest (`scforest`) is a timeline of single cell technology that charts the relationships between the different techniques developed in the past decade. The forest has several trees, each corresponding to one of the most common omics modalities currently in use: (spatial) transcriptomics, epigenomics, genomics and multiomics. Each leaf in the forest contains the name of a technique (clickable hyperlink) as well as a reference in classical format. The main file is `scforest.pdf`, but the LaTeX source in can be found in `scforest.tex`. Additionally, `sctech_review.pdf` gives a written description of a select number of single cell technologies.

Open for suggestions and alterations.

`scforest` was constructed using the LaTeX `tikz` and `forest` packages.
