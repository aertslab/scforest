# scforest, a visual overview of single cell technology
The single cell forest (`scforest`) is a timeline of single cell technology that also charts the relationships between the different single cell techniques developed over the years. The forest has several trees, each corresponding to one of the most common omics modalities currently in use: (spatial) transcriptomics, epigenomics, genomics and multiomics. The main file is `scforest.pdf`, but the LaTeX source in can be found in `scforest.tex`. Each leaf in the forest contains the name of a technique (clickable hyperlink to the correct webpage) as well as a reference in classical format. Additionally, `sctech_review.pdf` gives a written description of a select number of single cell technologies.

`scforest` was generated using the `forest` package.
